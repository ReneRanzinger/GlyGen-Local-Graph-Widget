This is an attempt at creating a typical bracket style layout with D3.  The data is just a mockup set using winners and challengers but could be just about anything.  Mid elbow connections are used to create the links and you can click on a node to collapse/expand it.

This probably isn't the best way to achieve this, but hey its a start :) and it works.
